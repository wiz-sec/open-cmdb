summary: |
  From June 2023 to March 2024, a vulnerability in Microsoft Graph allowed attackers to conduct password-spray attacks without detection. 
  The issue, labeled internally as VULN-107279, involved altering the authentication endpoint from a common one to that of an unrelated tenant, 
  thereby avoiding the appearance of logon attempts in the victim's logs. Although this technique could reveal valid user credentials through verbose error messages, 
  actual successful logons using these credentials would still be recorded in logs. Microsoft classified this vulnerability as low severity and did not issue a CVE.

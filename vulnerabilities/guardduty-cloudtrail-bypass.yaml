summary: | 
  GuardDuty detects CloudTrail being disabled, but did not detect if you
  filtered out all events from CloudTrail, resulting in defenders having no logs
  to review. Require privileged access in victim account, resulting in limited visibility.

  Setup detections independent of GuardDuty

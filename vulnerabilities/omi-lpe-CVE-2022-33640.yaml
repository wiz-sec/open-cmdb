summary: |
  OMI supports Kerberos as one of the authentication mechanisms. A fixed temp file is used while keeping OMI keytab in sync with the default keytab. 
  The temp file can be manipulated by an attacker to insert a new key in the omi keytab and gain elevated privileges on the machine. 
  The attacker must be locally logged in to the machine on which the OMI components are running.

summary: |
  Google Cloud Compute Engine (GCE) was vulnerable to SSH key injection via the SSH-in-browser service.
  An attacker could send a specially-crafted link to a victim, and if they were logged into GCP and clicked the link,
  the attacker's SSH username and password would be added to the target machine, thereby allowing the attacker to log into it.
  This was possible because no random token or CSRF protection had been implemented. For this attack to be successful,
  an attacker would need certain details of the machine in advance (including the project name, instance zone and instance name),
  and the machine would need to be configured to allow SSH connections from any IP address.

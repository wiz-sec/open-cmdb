summary: |
  The Microsoft Azure Site Recovery suite contains a DLL hijacking flaw that allows for privilege escalation from any low privileged user to SYSTEM. 
  Incorrect permissions on the service's executable directory (E:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\home\svsystems\transport\) 
  allow new files to be created by any user. 
  The service launched from this directory runs automatically and with SYSTEM privileges and attempts to load several DLLs from this directory. 
  This allows for a DLL hijacking/planting attack via several libraries that are attempted to be loaded from this location when the service is launched.

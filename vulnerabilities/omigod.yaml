summary: |
  Azure forces the install of an agent on Linux VMs, which contained a vulnerability
  that would grant root RCE if an attacker could send a web request to them. Initially,
  Microsoft did not update the agent automatically, and so customers had to patch manually,
  but a few days later they began patching some services remotely.
manualRemediation: |
  None required, client needed to be auto-updated.
detectionMethods: OMI version < 1.6.8.1

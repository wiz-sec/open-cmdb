 CVE-2023-36419 and CVE-2023-38156 are high severity privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Azure HDinsight. The root cause of the vulnerabilities
 are flaws in third-party services Apache Oozie and Apache Ambari, respectively, and they could allow an authenticated attacker with HDI cluster access to gain
 cluster administrator privileges and perform any resource service management operation. The vulnerabilities were patched in the October 2023 security update of Azure HDinsight.

summary: |
  Researchers discovered a vulnerability, CloudImposer, which could have allowed attackers to exploit Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services (App Engine, Cloud Functions, Cloud Composer)
  through a supply chain attack called dependency confusion. This attack could have compromised millions of users by introducing malicious packages into Google Cloud Composer, 
  a managed service for Apache Airflow. The vulnerability stemmed from Google's risky recommendation to use the --extra-index-url argument when installing private Python packages, 
  leading to potential code execution on internal Google servers. The issue was fixed by Google.

summary: |
  Having Contributor access to an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API Connection would allow you to create arbitrary role assignments as the connected user. 
  This was supposed to be limited to actions at the Resource Group level, but an attacker could escape to the Subscription or Root level with a path traversal payload.

summary: |
  AWS WAF using the Core Rules set allowed SQL injection. In AWS WAF only the first 8 KB (8,192 bytes) of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. Prior to publication, the AWS Managed rules allowed requests up to 10 KB.
  An attacker could send a request larger than 8 KB, and smaller than 10 KB, with malicious payload after 8,192 bytes, and pass the WAFs inspection. 
  In response AWS reduced the size limit to 8 KB.

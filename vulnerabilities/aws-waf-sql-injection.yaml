summary: |
  AWS WAF using the Core Rules set allowed SQL injection. In AWS WAF only the first 8 KB (8,192 bytes) of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection, but AWS Managed rules allowed requests up to 10 KB.
  An attacker could send a request larger than 8 KB but smaller than 10 KB, with a malicious payload located after the first 8,192 bytes, and thereby pass the WAFs inspection. 
  To fix this issue, AWS reduced the request size limit to 8 KB.

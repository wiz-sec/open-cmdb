summary: |
  A vulnerability in GCP's Vertex AI service allows privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive LLM models. Attackers can exfiltrate these models by exploiting misconfigurations in access controls and service bindings.

  **Privilege Escalation via Custom Jobs**  
  By exploiting custom job permissions, the researchers were able to escalate their privileges and gain unauthorized access to all data services in the project.

  **Model Exfiltration via Malicious Model**  
  Deploying a poisoned model in Vertex AI led to the exfiltration of all other fine-tuned models, posing a serious proprietary and sensitive data exfiltration attack risk.
